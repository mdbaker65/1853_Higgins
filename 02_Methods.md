# Sample handling

    1. Qubit quantify samples (see Background section for values)

# Library prep

    1. Used Direct cDNA Sequencing Kit

    2. Libraries submitted as cDNA

    3. Protocol started at End-Prep step

        - Discrepancy found in end-prep step of the protocol.
            NEBNext Ultra II End Repair/dA-tailing Module was listed in the Consumables section, however, Ultra II End-prep reaction buffer and Ultra II End-prep enzyme mix are listed in the reaction mix
                - Ultra II reagents were used for this library prep.

    4. Used S fragment buffer instead of WSB.

    Final Qubit = 0.586 ng/ul in 13ul for ~ 7.6ng (ideal is ~60ng)

# Sequencing

    1. Flow cell checked 

        - 1689 pores
    
    2. Spot-ON Flow Cell, R0 version (FLO-MIN106D) was used.
